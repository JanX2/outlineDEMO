this demo showcases my method:
+(CGMutablePathRef) newClosedPathWithWidth: (float) pw fromPath:(CGPathRef) path;

The function created the outline of a path.
It accepts a CGpath (closed or open) and outputs a CGpath  that surround the given one. You can specify the width of the outline created.
The mehtod uses Accelerate Frameworks for faster calculations.

In this demo 3 paths are used as inputs and 3 outline paths are created
Core Animation is used to animate the width of the outline and the rotation of one of the input paths.
The 3 input paths and the 2 outline paths produces are renered using core graphics. The third uutline is used as the shadowpath of a CAlayer.
