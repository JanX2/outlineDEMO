this demo showcases my method:

+(CGMutablePathRef) newClosedPathWithWidth: (float) pw fromPath:(CGPathRef) path;

The function creates the outline of a path.
It accepts a CGpath (closed or open) and outputs a CGpath  that surround the given one. You can specify the width of the outline created.
The mehtod uses Accelerate Framework for faster calculations.

In this demo 3 paths are used as inputs and 3 outline paths are created
Core Animation is used to animate custom propertis: the width of the outline and the rotation of one of the input paths.
The 3 input paths and the 2 outline paths produced are renered using core graphics. The third outline is used as the shadowpath of a CAlayer.
